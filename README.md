🚀 25 Days, 25 Startup Case Studies

This repository documents my learning journey where I study and publish one startup case study every day for 25 days.

My goal is to understand:

how ideas turn into scalable businesses

what strategies help startups grow

how brands position themselves in competitive markets

what lessons founders and students can learn from real companies

Each case study focuses on storytelling, strategy, challenges, and key takeaways.

🎯 Why I’m Doing This

I’m building consistency, improving research skills, and learning how real companies:

solve problems

grow sustainably

build strong brands

Documenting publicly keeps me accountable and hopefully helps others learn along the way.
